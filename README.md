# README

This test API was made during my [Creating a Rails API and fixing CORS issues](https://mikemerin.github.io/Rails-API-cors/) blog post. Use the completed files for reference.

To run this API in your terminal type in `rake db:reload` then `rake db:seed` for the pre-seeded data. After that type in `rails s` to start up your rails server and visit `http://localhost:3000/artists` or `http://localhost:3000/songs` for each model.
